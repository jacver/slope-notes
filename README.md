build express app

MongoDB - nonrelational DB

- Various collections that can communicate

Date Schema is app core - must be tied to resort (req. resort name in schema)

Resort collection seperate and seeded, data collection built by user 4. Seed resorts rather than schema for those dates so user selects from dropdown of existing resorts -> database call to resort - this would mean no need for resort schema since they'd be hardcoded
