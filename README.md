TO-DO

    -Delete specific routes within a date -- ID probably best here

    - When EDITING 
        -- Page hangs 
        -- Postman/MongoDB ARE updated. HOWEVER, HTML form adds EVERY resort name as a string: "1,2,3,4..."

    - Is text area linked to runNotes?

    - Can newDay have a selected dropdown item?

    - Form Validation (dates, runTime)

    - symbol on runcard for difficulty

    - pink card font change to white

    - pagate cards? >5 resorts = new page

    -- if no runs on a resort render something else

    -- 404 page render on error
